# VariousTools
Various tools and scripts I developed for my own use.

## auto_clicker.sh
This bash script auto clicks a chosen point every 5 seconds.\
Then restores the pointer location and focus back to the original window.\
If you want to pause the script, turn on Num Lock.\
Mouse will not be moved if a mouse button is pressed down.\
Script will retry in 0.5 seconds in that case.\
Works on Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS
